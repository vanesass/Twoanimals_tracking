'''
This is the main code to run analysis on data extracted from SLEAP.
If you are using this project, I recommend setting it in the same environment as SLEAP so
you donÂ´t have to re-download the packages that are required for analysis.
Some scripts were used from the website sleap.ai: https://sleap.ai/notebooks/Analysis_examples.html

    when we calculated velocity we calculated displacement per frame. 
    How many pixels per frame the rat moved. To calculate the travelled distance we can sum
    the total displacement across all frames.

'''
This is the main code to run analysis on data extracted from SLEAP.
If you are using this project, I recommend setting it in the same environment as SLEAP so
you donÂ´t have to re-download the packages that are required for analysis.
Some scripts were used from the website sleap.ai: https://sleap.ai/notebooks/Analysis_examples.html
